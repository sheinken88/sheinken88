<h1 align="center">Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm SebastiÃ¡n Heinken</h1>
<h3 align="center">A passionate frontend developer from Argentina, fueling the digital transformation</h3>

Ever since I delved into the world of coding through an intensive 800-hour full-time bootcamp, my perspective on the digital realm has transformed. Learning and implementing agile methodologies, pair programming, grasping the nitty-gritty of web development, project deployment, backend, and frontend have been an invigorating experience.

Currently, I'm honing my skills by working on **HIRE - a React Native app designed to aid programmers in acing coding interviews.** It's an ambitious project, but the process is as rewarding as the outcome.

Apart from this, my quest for learning never ends. At present, I'm diving deeper into **React Native, Firebase, and Typescript.**

As an ardent developer, I am not just looking for opportunities to code. I am in pursuit of challenges that allow me to leverage my skills to make a real-world impact. 

I am always open for collaboration and a good chat about development. Feel free to reach me at **heinken.sebastian@gmail.com**
